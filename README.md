# Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis in Python

This repository houses a Jupyter notebook that combines topic modeling and sentiment analysis to provide a dual approach to understanding textual data. It leverages Python's NLP capabilities to extract meaningful topics and sentiment orientations from text.

## Overview
This notebook is a comprehensive guide to implementing two pivotal NLP techniques: topic modeling, which identifies themes or topics within a large corpus, and sentiment analysis, which determines the sentiment expressed in text. It's designed to offer practical insights for data scientists and NLP practitioners.

## Key Features
- Introduction to topic modeling with techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Sentiment analysis using both pre-trained models and custom classifiers
- Detailed preprocessing of text for optimal model performance
- Visualization of topics and sentiment distributions across the dataset

## Libraries Used
- `gensim` for topic modeling
- `nltk` and `sklearn` for sentiment analysis and machine learning tasks
- `pandas` for data management
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

## Usage
This notebook serves as an educational tool for those interested in the technical aspects of NLP, as well as a practical guide for applying these techniques in various industries such as marketing, customer service, or social media analysis.

## Contributions
We encourage contributions that could improve the models' accuracy, introduce efficiency in preprocessing, or expand the scope of the analysis to include real-time data feeds or additional languages. Suggestions for integrating newer NLP tools or frameworks are also welcome.
